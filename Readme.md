# Tokenized Lending of Study Materials

## Project Description
The **Tokenized Lending** platform is a blockchain-based solution for lending and borrowing study materials. Owners of study materials can list their resources on the platform, setting a collateral value to ensure the safe return of their materials. Borrowers can access these resources by depositing the collateral, which is refunded upon return of the material. 

This decentralized system promotes knowledge sharing, trust, and transparency among users.
